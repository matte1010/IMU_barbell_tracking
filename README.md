# IMU_barbell_tracking
Project for tracking a barbell with imu sensor/sensors.

## How to run

Run the html file in a chrome browser to start the sensor. Stop the sensor with stop button and then save values with any of the save buttons. The Values will be saved to a 6DOF.json file. Open the 6DOF.json file in postcalcAHRS.py for filtering with extended kalman filter and calculation of velocites. This is done in post processing after the data sampling of the movement. The AHRS library will need to be cloned from the github repository. Follow the instructions from this link: https://ahrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html.
